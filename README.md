# Degree Of Extrapolation

This repository hosts code and data to calculate the extent to which forest and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models extrapolate beyond the bounds of the training data (known as the degree of extrapolation). 

Note that the code for random forests must be run with 32bit R for the gradientForest package to run correctly.
